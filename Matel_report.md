Mantel Test: correlating matrices
---------------------------------

This documented was created in order to output the results of the Mantel analysis. As discussed during the last Nchain meeting (NChain5) we want to find genes that are disrespecting genospecies boundaries, which are normally those genes that are horizontally acquired.

``` python
a = [1,2,3]

for i in a:
  print i
```

    ## 1
    ## 2
    ## 3

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
